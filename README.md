# Password-Generator

My first ever app using Electron!

This is my first ever passion project! 

i made it since i was tired of having to come up with new creative passwords lol.

Hope you enjoy it!

Steps:

1. After cloning it, start npm with "npm install"
2. then use npm run build to build the app in your platform!
3. The outcome should be at your downloads folder.

Attention!

The process should take some minutes to set up, but at the end, you should end up with a nice little app that generates very diverse passwords!

It works from the tray so whenever you run it, make sure to pay attention to it! (sorry for the dark icon!)
